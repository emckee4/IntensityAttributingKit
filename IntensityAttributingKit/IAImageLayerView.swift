/**
 IAImageLayerView sits within the IACompositeBase derived view above the text layers but beneath the selection layer. It provides the actual display of images as layed out by the topTV layoutManager with which it interacts under the direction of the IACompositeBase derived view. This arrangement allows some flexibility in the rendering process and minimizes the number of times that the image data needs to be accessed or drawn (in the stages performed by the CPU at least), at the cost of further compositing work for the GPU. Separating the images from the text layers also allows us to vary the text layer opacity for the purposes of animation without affecting the images.
