IntensityAttributingKit (v2)
Â© 2015 by Evan McKee

IntensityAttributingKit is a swift framework which provides a means of creating, displaying, and converting text with "intensity" attributes by the user on an iOS device. Ideally the user would have a 3dTouch capable phone so that intensity of a character can be derived from the pressure applied to the key, but intensity can also be applied using touch duration or a manual control.



Next steps:

    After completing a word or changing selection from a word, whole unit (chosen by smoothing method) should be rerendered if necessary to reflect smoothed unit value

    Multiple keysets
        -> eventually make more/all keys potentially expanding if performance is sufficient

    Support additional attachment types

    Make IATextView and possibly IATextEditor not subclasses of UITextView.


Additional render schemes (if possible):
    static fade
    dynamic/pulsing fade
    animated glyphs
    animated colored shadows
