IntensityAttributingKit (v1 proof of concept)
Â© 2015 by Evan McKee
**** This version has been superseded by a rewritten version 2 with a cleaner interface, cleaner code in general, improved UI, better performance, and more features. Version 2 is currently private while I prepare to release the app for which it was written. If you're interested in seeing it in action or getting access to the new source, visit www.intensitymessaging.com or contact me.


IntensityAttributingKit is a swift framework which provides a means of creating, displaying, and converting text with "intensity" attributes by the user on an iOS device. Ideally the user would have a 3dTouch capable phone so that intensity of a character can be derived from the pressure applied to the key, but intensity can also be applied using touch duration or a manual control.
