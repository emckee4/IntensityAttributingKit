-- find optimal stackview spacing first


Adding IATextView:
    -interface with IAString should minimize exposure to particulars of the current IAString implementation
    -IAString needs a function to process current and old typingAttributes in order to determine user selection. This must be a part of the transformer and protocol
    --need to implement better image and link handling than proto IATextView

-- need placeholder keyboard, accessory view for IATV to work

Keyboard:
    need equations for layouts of keyboard taking into account:
    screen size (iphone 6s, 6s plus: since no other devices have force touch we shouldn't even show them the pressure keyboard')
        orientation (portrait/landscape)
    __ should try textTitles and spritekit options (or custom spritesheet) for speed initializing


Accessory View:
    need different accessories for forcetouch vs standard keyboard
    need to determine layout and features for each








IAString Performance
    Keeping "deep" IAattributes may significantly increase storage size
        It may be possible to retain most of the performance benefits of deep attributes through a combination of partition and removal by range in the transform function
        "shallow" IAAttributes would let us invalidate all in a transform, letting us skip the setter check, and possibly perform more actions by range
